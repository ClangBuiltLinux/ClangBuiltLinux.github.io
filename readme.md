## Architecture Support

The following architectures are targetable from both LLVM and the Linux kernel
and are relatively well supported and tested:
* arm
* arm64
* hexagon
* s390
* x86

The following architectures are targetable from both LLVM and the Linux kernel
and are known to work in specific/limited configurations and supported on a
best-effort basis:
* mips
* powerpc
* riscv
* um (usermode)

The following architectures are targetable from both LLVM and the Linux kernel
but are untested or currently broken:
* arc
* csky
* m68k
* sparc

The following architectures are targetable from the Linux kernel but not LLVM:
* alpha
* microblaze
* nios2
* openrisc
* parisc
* sh
* xtensa

The following architectures are targetable from LLVM but not the Linux kernel:
* amdgpu
* avr
* bpf
* lanai
* msp430
* nvptx
* ve
* webassembly
* xcore

> [!NOTE]
> s390 is not fully supported by ld.lld and as such [requires special care to build properly](https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/1524)
